      <p>About 10 years ago, chartering a private jet seemed to be a lifetime dream. Nowadays, these luxury services are available for a wider audience. The blossom of the private jet charter business can be easily explained: they provide more flexibility and better pandemic-related safety measures (if compared to busy airports and lack of personal space onboard), they are cheaper than first-class of ordinary flights.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In the USA, private jets are in high demand – commercial flights don’t often allow traveling between two desired destinations. Yet, with the increasing number of newcomers, the amount of issues and problems related to hiring a private jet grows as well.</p>

      <p>First, there are simply <b>not enough aircraft and pilots</b> to serve them all. Most people, not being able to travel in 2020 because of lockdowns and restrictions, try to compensate for what they have missed this year. In addition to that, many of those who could afford traveling with luxury decided to join the club. Health is the priority, not the money. As a result, the demand for planes keeps growing, and people are forced to be patient – especially during high seasons or holidays.</p>
      <p>Christmas and Thanksgiving are traditionally the two busiest periods. If not booking a jet in advance, you risk not having one at all.</p>
      <p>How to make sure that you will get a private jet or a helicopter without delays and waiting? Avoid using local companies based in one city. For example, with us, you will be able to see all available aircraft for charter, depending on your location. Therefore, better choice and faster service. No matter what type of aircraft you are looking for – light or business jet – the available planes will be displayed on the map.</p>
      <p>Second, it’s <b>astronomical fees</b>. The industry was not ready for the growing demand after the pandemic but used the situation in their favor. This is mostly related to third-party companies that serve as intermediaries between the fliers and operators. They immediately reacted to the increasing demand for private flights by charging clients more than usual.</p>

      <p>Why is it important to tame the fees? Well, it’s just about saving money, right? If you want to pay a fixed fee and enjoy a private trip, be sure to charter a private jet on our website. We charge only 2,5% regardless of the distance and type of aircraft.</p>
      <p>Third, it’s a necessity to buy a membership to use the services. The majority of companies insist on getting a membership: it’s convenient for frequent fliers. However, the cost of this membership is not cheap. On average, you will have to pay around $100 per month (apart from the ticket price, of course).</p>
      <p>Membership has its benefits, especially if you travel at least several times per month. Yet, for rare and occasional travels, it’s not necessary. Be sure to check if a company requires you to join the membership program before booking a flight. Or just use our service – any can charter any private jet without additional programs and burdening memberships.</p>
      <p>Fourth, and this is the most important issue, is <b>fraudulent companies offering fake or illegal flights</b>. They have become quite a problem recently. Seeing the increasing desire of wealthy people to pay for private jets, they create websites with stolen photos, texts, and even use the names of trustworthy companies.</p>

      <p>This is a serious matter, as it doesn’t concern losing a few hundreds of bucks or the absence of planes. Such activity aims to steal thousands of dollars by deceiving customers, especially newcomers. Once they get the money, the fake brokers stop replying to emails and simply disappear.</p>
      <p>What is the best way to protect yourself from fraudsters? Do research about any broker you’re dealing with for the first time. The victims of such frauds don’t remain silent. Do not hesitate to ask for references and check the validity of a phone number.</p>
      <p>In general, a jet charter is still the same affordable and available as in the pre-Covid era. The growing popularity of private flights should never become an obstacle between you and your comfort. Be sure to hire a reliable broker with efficient experience to entrust with your flights.</p>
      <p><b>Key statistics outlined in the Waypoint 2050 pathways include:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>By 2050, the industry will connect over 10 billion passengers a year, with traffic growing 2.5 times higher than 2019,  but also reaching net-zero CO2 emissions.</li>
        <li>Radical new technologies such as new configurations of aircraft, introducing hybrid power architectures or shifting to electricity or hydrogen as a source of power could contribute between 12% and 34% of the needed emissions reductions.</li>
        <li>Sustainable aviation fuels could contribute between 53% and 71% of required carbon reductions.</li>
        <li>Improving the way the sector operates and provides infrastructure could reduce emissions between 7% and 10%.</li>
        <li>And carbon removals will likely be needed for around 8% of residual emissions in 2050.</li>
      </ul>
